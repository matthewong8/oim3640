## My Mini Project 1 Proposal (Workout Tracker)

**What I'm building:** I will be building a simple workout tracker that records exercises and prints a summary of my workout session since currently I've been trying to be in the gym more consistently and having this will allow me to be more motivated.

**Why I chose this:** I’m trying to be more consistent in the gym, and I want a quick tool to log what I did (sets, reps, weight) and see my total volume for the session, I would also hopefully want to see some significant progress with this in terms of volume and weights I can handle which I think will be good for motivation and progress development.

**Core features:**
- I will add an exercise (specific to its name, what body part it targets, maybe a brief description of what it helps with) with sets, reps, and weight
- Calculate volume (sets * reps * weight) for each exercise
- Show a session summary (all exercises + total volume)
- Include a menu so I can add multiple exercises in one run
- Validate user input (no negative numbers, handle non-numeric input)

**What I don't know yet:**
- The cleanest way to validate inputs without making the code messy
- How to format the session summary so it’s easy to read
- Whether I should store exercises as lists of dictionaries or another structure
