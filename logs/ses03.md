Set Up of Today:
- Setting up the notebook by linking the chapters into VS Code by unzipping the downloaded file

Chapter 1 Learning:
- Programming is a way of thinking meaning you have to learn to think in a new way
- Combining mathematics, engineering and natural science
- arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /)
- 2 types of numbers in python:
  - Integers: numbers with no fractional or decimal part
  - floating-point numbers: integers and numbers with a decimal point
- (+, -, *) = integer
- dividing 2 integers = floating point number
- integer division or floor division = (//)
- exponentiation / power = (**)
- ^ is a bitwise operator called XOR
- Collection of operators and numbers = expression
  - example: 6+6**2
  - follows order of operations
  - value is the result of the expression
- Arithmetic Functions:
  - round function takes a floating point number and roundsit off to the nearest integer for example: round(42.4)
  - 'abs' = absolute value
  - We can call this "function call"
  - syntax error = there is something wrong with the structure of the expression
  - a function call requires parentheses
- Strings:
  - Sequences of letters: 'Hello', "World"
  - Double quote or single quote works
  - '+' operator works with strings; it joins two strings into a single string = concatenation
  - '*' operator also works with strings, it makes multiple copies of a string and concatenates them (repeats it however many times)
  - Function called "len" that computes the length of a string
  - len counts the letters between the quotes, but not the quotes
- Values and types:
  - A kind of value is called a type
  - function called type that tells you the type of any value
  - The types int, float, and str can be used as functions. For example, int can take a floating-point number and convert it to an integer (always rounding down) same with float
  - Putting a sequence of digits in quotes is a string and using it like a number will get you an error
  - You must convert strings to numbers before doing math:
    - int('126') / 3 → 42.0
    - float('12.6') → 12.6
  - Using commas in numbers creates a tuple, not a number:
    - 1,000,000 → (1, 0, 0)
  - Use underscores for readable large numbers:
    - 1_000_000 → 1000000
- Formal vs Natural Languages
  - Natural languages (English, Spanish, etc.):
    - Evolved naturally
    - Ambiguous
    - Redundant and expressive
  - Formal languages (math notation, programming languages):
    - Designed for specific purposes
    - Unambiguous
    - Concise and literal
  - Key differences:
    - Ambiguity: natural = ambiguous, formal = precise
    - Redundancy: natural = verbose, formal = efficient
    - Literalness: formal languages mean exactly what they say
  - Formal languages:
    - Are denser and slower to read
    - Require strict structure
    - Are sensitive to small errors (syntax matters)
- Debugging
  - Bugs are programming errors.
  - Debugging is finding and fixing bugs.
  - Debugging can be emotionally frustrating (normal and expected).
  - Helpful mindset:
    - Think of the computer as fast and precise but not intuitive.
    - Your role is to manage it clearly and logically.
  - Debugging is a transferable skill beyond programming.

Chapter 2 Learning:
- Variables
  - Name that refers to a value
    - created using an assignment statement
      - n = 17
    - asignment statement parts:
      - variable name (left)
      - = operator
      - expression (right)
    - Variables can store:
      - integers (n = 17)
      - floats (pi = 3.14)
      - strings (message = "Hello")
    - Assignment statements produce no output
    - variables can be used:
      - in expressions: n+25
      - with operators 2*pi
      - in function calls: round(pi), len(message)
  - State diagrams
    - visual way to represent variables
    - variable name points to its value
    - shows the state of a program at a moment in time
    - used to model how python stores value
- Variable names
    - can contain letters and numbers
    - cannot start with a number
    - underscore _ is allowed
    - convention: use lowercase
    - illegal names cause syntax errors
    - keywords cannot be used as variable names
    - examples of illegal names:
      - million! (punctuation)
      - 76trombones (starts with number)
      - class (keyword)
    - keywords have special meanings in python
    - editors usually highlight keywords automatically
- the import statement
  - used to access features not built into core python
  - a module is a file containing variables and functions
  - example;
    - import math
  - access module contents using the dot operator:
    - math.pi
    - math.sqrt(25)
  - common math functions:
    - math.sqrt() = square root
    - math.pow(x, y) = exponentiation
  - exponentiation operator ** is preerred over math.pow
- Expressions vs statements:
  - expression:
    - produces a value
    - can include variables, operators, and function calls
  - statement:
    - performs an action
    - has no value
  - examples:
    - expression: 19+n+round(math.pi)
    - statement: n=17, import math
  - evaluation = computing an expression's value
  - execution = running a statement
- the print() function:
  - expressions display only the last evaluated value
  - print() displays values explicitly
  - can print:
    - numbers
    - strings
    - expressions
  - can print multiple values seperated by commas:
    - prnt('Pi is', math.pi)
  - print() automatically adds spaces between arguments
- Arguments:
  - arguments are values passed into a function
  - functions can take
    - one argument: int('101)
    - two arguments: math.pow (5, 2)
    - optional arguments: round(math.pi, 3)
    - any number of arguments: print()
  - Common argument related errors (TypeError):
    - too many arguments
    - too few arguments
    - wrong argument type
  - type checking helps catch bugs early
- comments:
  - comments explain code in natural language
  - start with #
  - ignored by python when running code
  - used to explain
    - why something is done
    - non obvious logic
  - good comments add information not obvious from code
  - bad comments restate the code itself
  - clear variable names reduce the need for commments
- Debugging:
  - three types of errors:
    - syntax: code structure is invalid
    - runtime errors (exceptions): errors during execution
    - semantic errors: program runs but gives wrong result
    - Examples:
      - illegal variable name = syntax error
      - dividing string by number = runtime error
      - wrong math due to order of operations = semantic error
    - semantic errors are hardest to find
