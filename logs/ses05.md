# Learnings of Today
- Reviewed the difference between integers and floats
  - integers and floats are both variables that store numbers
  - floats specifically, contain decimal points
- 17 % 5 gives you the remainder after the integer division (modular operator)
  - because 17/5 is 3.4, take the 3 and the remainder is 2
  - Why?
- Make variable name as clear as possible for clearer understanding
- Expression vs statement:
  - expression evaluates but does not do anything with it
  - a statement, which prints the result
- Types:
  - a bool type: checks expressions whether it's true or false
- Comments is a good habit to have
  - AI has a good habit to use comments
  - if you need an explanation for your code use a comment
- always define (def) or you will get an error
- doctrine """..."""
- A function is a named block of code that:
  - Performs a specific task
  - Can take inputs (arguments)
  - Can produce an output (return value)
  - Think of a function as a machine:
  - Input → Process → Output

# What I don't understand?
- I'm trying to run my code for the a % 2 exercise but it's not running and I'm getting errors
- I'm also confused how to toggle the microsoft copilot AI to help for autofill or generating code since it was too fast
- the difference between print and return
