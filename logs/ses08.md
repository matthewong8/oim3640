# Week 8 (Feb 12)

## What I learned this week & General Notes
- Don't forget to work on the mini project while you progress through this course
- In the next 2 weeks, have something (work on something)
- 3 required throughout this semester (1-2 elective)
- Projects:
    - 1. Your first python app (Functions, Logic, User Interaction)
    - 2. Text analysis (Strings, files, dicts)
    - 3. Web App (Flask, HTML, APIs)
- Finis each project in 2-3 weeks
- If you know how to draw a square, you can draw a spiral (think of it this way)
- Boolean expressions
  - expressions that evaluate to true or false
    - x = 5
    - x == 5 #true (equality)
    - x != 3 #true (not equal)
    - x > 10 #false (greater than)
    - x >= 5 #true (greater than or equal)
  - recursion (movie: groundhog day)
